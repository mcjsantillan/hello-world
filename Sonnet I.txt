I have watched you walk by the window every single day
And it seems like everytime you make my heart skip a beat
I wanted to talk to you but I don't know what to say
Now all I need to do is try to sweep you off your feet

She always walks in beauty and everything seems to stop
The way she looks at you makes you want to faint instantly
Her smile is very stunning and it will make your jaw drop
It's as if everything about her is perfect to me

And now the way that she talks there's a calmness within her
She will always uplift you any given time or day
I don't know her too well yet and it all may seem a blur
I'm sure that she's a great girl that's the least that I can say

I hope that she keeps in mind when she's sad and all alone
That I'm always here for her, she can text or call me home.
