The Reasons You Are Beautiful
by Daniel Erdle 

To the girl whose beauty is present in all seasons 
I tell you why you are beautiful, here are the reasons: 

Your beauty extends into the heavens, 
it goes on forever and never lessens. 
Even when the clouds heighten 
you are here and the world brightens. 
You are like a fruit that constantly ripens 
your beauty continues to grow no mater what happens. 

My fondness for you constantly deepens 
because every time I see you my heart starts to weaken. 
You make everything else appear hollow 
where ever you are loveliness is sure to follow. 
You shine so bright you cast your own shadow 
a beauty that others would love to borrow. 
But try as they might your beauty they will never catch 
because something like you they could never match. 

Your beauty seems to increase with every breathe 
it tests the limits my imagination can stretch. 
It makes me question if what I am seeing is real 
I only know it is true by the way that I feel. 
Your beauty is so vast it can't be concealed 
there is no hiding it your beauty is always revealed. 

The power of your beauty is the world's greatest gift 
the heaviest boulder it could easily lift. 
A girl this perfect I never knew 
all that changed the moment I met you. 
Heaven on Earth I was not aware 
until I met a girl that was crafted with such care. 
You would be the answer to a prayer 
if someone asked for something rare with beauty to spare. 

If I had a choice I would choose this girl over air 
for air can't compare to a girl not found elsewhere.
